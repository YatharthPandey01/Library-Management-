# Library-Management-
A simple project of library management system made using python.
Used the concept of Object Oriented Programmimg in this project.

Created a library class and student class where in library class i added methods like display to show the list of available books,
borrow method so that a student has the option to borrow the book and return book method so that the student can return the book easily.

Similarly in  student class i added a request book method and return book method

finally i used an infinite while loop so that the program can execute infinitely and can select from the options.
